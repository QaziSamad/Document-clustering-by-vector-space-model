Real Madrid made light work of Dinamo Zagreb winning 6-2 to make it five straight wins in Group D of the Champions League on a rainy night in the Spanish capital.
The Spaniards proved their strength in depth by resting key players in Iker Casillas, Cristiano Ronaldo and Pepe and sharing the goals around with Karim Benzema and Jose Callejon scoring twice and Gonzalo Higuain and Mesut Ozil also on the scoresheet.
The result leaves the Croatians pointless, Fatos Beciraj and Ivan Tomecak got late consolations for them, and confirms their last position in Group D.
