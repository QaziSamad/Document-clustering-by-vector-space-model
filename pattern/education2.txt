When it comes to Rhodes Scholars, Stanford University can now boast a record five students or recent graduates among the 32 Americans selected in a single year for the prestigious award.
"It's terrific for those five students, and Stanford should be appropriately proud,'' Elliot Gerson, American secretary of the Rhodes Trust, said on Sunday after the 2012 winners were announced.
Ishan Nath and Tenzin Seldon, both seniors at Stanford, along with recent graduates Aysha Bagchi, Anand Habib and Katherine Niehaus, were awarded the coveted scholarships, which provide all expenses for up to three years of study at the University of Oxford in England. Five winners are the most Stanford ever had in a single year, and no other school had more this year.
