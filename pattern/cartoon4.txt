Scottish actor James McAvoy says he’ll only sign up for the follow-up to X-Men: First Class if the film's makers have a decent story.

He starred as Charles Xavier – aka Professor X – in the 60s-set summer blockbuster, which was helmed by Kick-Ass director Matthew Vaughn and acted as a prequel to previous X-Men movies.

Currently promoting animated movie Arthur Christmas, which is currently out in cinemas, McAvoy has been raving about the idea for the sequel.
