With Art Basel Miami Beach drawing nigh, deep-pocketed collectors, shallow-intentioned jetsetters, and everyone between is getting ready to touch down in Miami for days on end of excess in excess. To help out, we've curated a list of confirmed shows between Wednesday, Nov. 30, and Sunday, Dec. 4, from the Miami Music Guide. (Emphasis on "confirmed", as there are several exciting shows, including TV on the Radio, Sharon Jones, and Nas, that are as much rumor as fact at the moment.) Head over to Beached Miami blog for a rundown of ABMB music shows.
