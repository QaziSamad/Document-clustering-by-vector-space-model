Celebrity designers, established and emerging artists from Miami and around the world and one of Miami's "showman mixologists" converge November 30 at The Ritz-Carlton, South Beach to launch Art Basel with the 8th installment of the Master's Mystery Art Show (MMAS) to raise money for the Florida International University Master's in Fine Arts Program. This year, some of the world's top fashion designers are using white t-shirts as their canvases to create wearable art that knows no bounds. Each piece will be an original expression of the designer and be auctioned off that evening.
