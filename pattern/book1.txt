"V Is for Vengeance" (Marian Wood Book/G.P. Putnam's Sons), by Sue Grafton: "V Is for Vengeance," and it's also for very, very good.

With just a few letters remaining in Sue Grafton's alphabet series of mysteries, the author has hit a high mark with her latest offering, a complex tale of love, betrayal, ambition and, of course, murder.

"V Is for Vengeance" begins with Kinsey Millhone nursing a broken nose (and two black eyes) that she got from poking it into other people's business.
