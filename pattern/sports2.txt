Karim Benzema and Jose Callejon scored two goals each as a rampant Real Madrid, without their full cast of stars, crushed Dinamo Zagreb 6-2 to win Group D in the Champions League on Tuesday.
It was never a contest at the Santiago Bernabeu as Benzema netted after just 84 seconds before Callejon and Gonzalo Higuain put the already-qualified Madrid 3-0 up inside nine minutes from their first three shots. Mesut Oezil scored in the 20th for Madrid to go into the break with a comfortable margin, which Callejon and Benzema added to in the 49th and 66th minutes, respectively.
