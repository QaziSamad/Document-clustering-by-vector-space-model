Pew researchers discovered that the number of religious groups lobbying people in Washington, D.C., has increased 500 percent in the past four decades, from fewer than 40 in 1970 to more than 200 today. With more than 1,000 lobbyists vying for the ears of Congress members, the groups together spend more than $390 million a year to shape not only public policy but also the political process itself.

Roman Catholic, Protestant and Jewish advocacy groups make up 58 percent of the groups in the study.
