Warner Bros Online Shops offers the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 DVD and Blu-ray sets with several additional collectible items, including a Hogwarts tree ornament, Gringotts collectible case, Hogwarts crests pins and bookmarks, Dumbledore and Harry's wand pens with bookmarks, and a 48-page photo album commemorating highlights of the film series. The photo album is a favorite of ours as it has the same cover as Harry's photo album - the one that Hagrid presented to him at the end of the first film - and the first image is of baby Harry with parents James and Lily.
