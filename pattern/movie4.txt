So Mr. Potter, the end to your adventures has finally come. Ten years and seven movies (longer than that if we start with J. K. Rowling's novels) have all led to this. HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS PART 2 is the polar opposite of DEATHLY HALLOWS PART 1. DEATHLY HALLOWS PART 1 was a mostly quiet, very personal, very intimately intense story. All of the sub-plots that have been brewing and percolating through the previous six films were coming together; everything was now not only going in the same direction, they were all in the same double-decker bus.
