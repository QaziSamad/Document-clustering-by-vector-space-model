"V Is for Vengeance" (Marian Wood Book/G.P. Putnam's Sons), by Sue Grafton: "V Is for Vengeance," and it's also for very, very good.

The story begins with, in crime-fiction terms, a rather humble case: shoplifting. The unfashionable Kinsey, uncharacteristically shopping at Nordstrom, witnesses a pair of women bagging lingerie and alerts the clerk. The incident escalates to a chase during which Kinsey is nearly run down by one of the perps racing her car out of the parking garage.

What the reader finds out — ahead of Kinsey — is that the women are members of a huge, professional shoplifting ring.
