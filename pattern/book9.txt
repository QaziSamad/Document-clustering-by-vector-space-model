The plot, which begins at a more leisurely pace as Sue Grafton introduces the many characters, picks up speed and momentum as pieces are drawn together and the stakes get higher. From the relatively innocuous shoplifting escapade, the novel builds to a climactic shootout in a warehouse that has an effect on every character.

About the only disappointing aspect of V Is for Vengeance is that Kinsey’s suave, elderly landlord, Henry, spends the novel out of town tending to his 99-year-old sister. Presumably, he’ll be back for the rest of the alphabet.
