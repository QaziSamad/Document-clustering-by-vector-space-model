The parents of little Adolf Hitler and Aryan Nation have lost their attempt to regain custody of a newborn boy.

Heath and Deborah Campbell went to court Monday in Flemington, N.J., after authorities seized the newborn at the hospital when he was born five days earlier.

The couple’s three older children, all with Nazi-inspired names, are in foster care.

“They kidnapped our kid,” Heath Campbell, with a large swastika on his neck and a Hitler-style moustache, said outside the courtroom. “They look at you because of what you wear. I’m German, so what?”
