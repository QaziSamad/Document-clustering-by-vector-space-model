Kanye West is quoting philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche in an attempt to convince the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals to uphold the dismissal of a claim that he stole his hit song “Stronger” from another songwriter.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, a brief submitted Friday shows West’s lawyers making the case that it’s absurd for the plaintiff, Vincent Peters, to make a copyright allegation on a rap lyric said to derive from one of Nietzsche’s century-old maxims: “That which does not kill us makes us stronger.”
