Real Madrid made it five wins from five in Group D of the Champions League on Tuesday with a 6-2 rout of Dinamo Zagreb in the Santiago Bernabeu stadium.
The Spanish league leaders rested Cristiano Ronaldo, Iker Casillas and Pepe but still raced into a four goal lead inside 20 minutes.
The result leaves the Croatians pointless, Fatos Beciraj and Ivan Tomecak got late consolations for them, and confirms their last position in Group D.
