Stanford University students won five Rhodes Scholarships, while Harvard, Brown and Princeton students took four each as the 32 U.S. recipients of one of the world's most prestigious academic awards were named today.

Among this year's winners were Ronan Farrow, Bard's youngest graduate ever at 15 in 2004, who grew up with 14 adopted siblings from seven countries speaking six languages, the Rhodes Trust said. Bard is located in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York.
