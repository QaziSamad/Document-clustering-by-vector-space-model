Taylor Swift had more than one very special guest join her onstage Tuesday night at a sold-out show at NYC's Madison Square Garden, her last stop on her worldwide "Speak Now" tour.

Later on in the show, Rock and Roll Hall of Famer James Taylor graced the stage for another first-ever duet of his classic "Fire and Rain." Swift told the crowd that she was named after the legendary singer, 63. The elder Taylor stayed onstage to play guitar for Swift's hit "15"

When Gomez (Justin Bieber's love) later the stage for a bow, she'd changed out of her sparkly mini-dress -- and was wearing a Taylor Swift tour T-shirt!
