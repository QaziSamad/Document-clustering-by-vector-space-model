Real Madrid thrashed lowly Coratian side Dinamo Zagreb 6-2 to secure their spot atop their group in the UEFA Champions League on Tuesday night. Frenchman Benzema slotted home from Ozil's pullback after a swift passing move sliced open the visitors, and former Real youth team forward Callejon finished off a swift break.

Argentine Higuain cut inside his marker and then dinked the ball over the keeper at his near post, before Germany's Ozil put away a loose ball after Higuain's shot had been parried.

Callejon broke the offside trap to slot away number five in the 49th and Benzema made it 6-0 on 66 minutes.
