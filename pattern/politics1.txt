A New Jersey couple who named their children 'Adolf Hitler' and 'JoyceLynn Aryan Nation' have lost custody of their newborn son.
Heath and Deborah Campbell were told to hand over their baby Hons to welfare officials immediately after she gave birth at Hunterdon Medical Center on Thursday.
A New Jersey judge ruled on Monday that the baby would stay in the state's care. Authorities maintained it was done because of violence, not their Nazi-inspired names.
