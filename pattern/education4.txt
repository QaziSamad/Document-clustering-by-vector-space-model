Stanford senior Tenzin Seldon was up all night fielding congratulatory phone calls from family, friends, loved ones and supporters in India, after the Rhodes Trust announced that she was one of 32 Americans who were named 2012 Rhodes Scholars.

Seldon, who was born and raised in a small hilltop town in the Himalayas, is the first Tibetan American to win a Rhodes Scholarship, which provides all expenses for two or three years of study at the University of Oxford in England.
