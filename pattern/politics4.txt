A New Jersey white supremacist couple, who have already had three kids seized from them by authorities, lost custody of their newborn son 17 hours after he was born.

Heath and Deborah Campbell gained notoriety for giving their children Nazi-inspired names - Adolf Hitler Campbell, JoyceLynn Aryan Nation Campbell and Honszlynn Hinler Jeannie Campbell.

The latest child in their brood - Hons Campbell - was taken by child welfare officials last Thursday from the Hunterdon Medical Center. The other children were taken in January 2009 and placed in foster homes.
