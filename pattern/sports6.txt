Karim Benzema and Jose Callejon scored twice with Gonzalo Higuain and Mesut Ozil also on the scoresheet.
Fatos Beciraj and Ivan Tomecak grabbed consolation goals for the Croatian visitors in the second half, but they remained in bottom spot in the section without a point. Real's pace and aggression were too much for the Croatian champions. Real's victory canter made it five wins from five and put them seven points head of second-placed Ajax Amsterdam.
