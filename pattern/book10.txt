With V Is for Vengeance, released today, Sue Grafton has charged her way through the alphabet in a crime series that has endeared millions of fans to scrappy private detective Kinsey Millhone.

Grafton traverses among several points of view in the story but returns regularly and at greater length to her stalwart protagonist, who celebrates her birthday at the height of the plot’s action, on a spring day in 1988. Grafton remains true to the period — no text messages or Internet research here — and keeps the action percolating.
