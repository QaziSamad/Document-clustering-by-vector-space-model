The notorious New Jersey couple who gave their children Nazi-inspired names won't receive custody of their newborn son, a court ruled.

Child welfare agents took custody of little Hons Campbell just hours after he was delivered to parents Heath and Deborah Campbell last Thursday.

The couple's three other children - Adolf Hitler, JoyceLynn Aryan Nation and Honszlynn Hinler Jeannie - were taken into custody in 2009.
