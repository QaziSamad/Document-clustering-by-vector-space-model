Kanye West has been in a court battle recently after Virginia rapper Vince P (real name Vincent Peters) claimed that he himself had written the 2007 hit "Stronger." Both rappers claim the Nietzsche quote "that which doesn't kill me makes me stronger" as an influcence for their respective song's chorus.'

Mr. Peters claims that Mr. West took the song after Mr. Peters gave Mr. West's business manager–named, no joke, John Monopoly–a demo CD several years ago.
