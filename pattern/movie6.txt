For the record, this was not the greatest Potter film by a long shot. It was clearly half a movie, and, with its inside-Quidditch references and nearly nonexistent effort to do much more than transcribe the novel, it was clearly aimed only at fans, not the casual moviegoer. Critics said they liked it. Critics were also terrified at pissing off most of America. DEATHLY HALLOWS PART 2 picks up exactly where PART 1 ended with Harry, Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) still on the beach having narrowly escaped the clutches of Bellatrix LeStrange (Helena Bonham Carter.)
