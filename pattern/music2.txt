Taylor Swift closed her "Speak Now World Tour" with her best friend and the man her parents named her after.

The 21-year-old brought out James Taylor and Selena Gomez at her concert Tuesday night at New York's Madison Square Garden. Gomez joined the country singer earlier in the night, where the two sang a duet version of Gomez's hit tune "Who Says."
