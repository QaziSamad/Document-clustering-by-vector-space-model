James McAvoy has said he'll only make a sequel to X-Men: First Class if the story is "intelligent" enough.
The Scottish actor, who played Charles Xavier in the Matthew Vaughn-directed sci-fi adventure film, said a follow-up would only go ahead if the script was a good one.
He told Collider: "I've heard a little bit about what's happening. The director has got a fantastic idea for what the story will be. I can't really tell you what it is because we may or may not make that, but we've got to do something intelligent with it."
