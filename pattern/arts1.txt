In one decade, Art Basel Miami Beach has catapulted from lively newcomer on the art fair scene in the Americas to an annual destination for the international contemporary art set. This year's 10th edition, from Dec. 1 to 4, features more than 260 leading galleries from North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa, showcasing works by more than 2,000 artists of the 20th and 21st centuries.
Satellite fairs such as the inaugural edition of AOA Tribal Art Miami, museum exhibitions, exclusive art parties, public installations, and a new auction venue are among the concurrent activities that draw tens of thousands of visitors each year.
Of note for 2011, special programming from Art Basel includes the U.S. premiere of Corinna Belz's film 'Gerhard Richter Painting' which presents an intriguing portrait of the artist at work.
