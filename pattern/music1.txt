Taylor Swift had more than one very special guest join her onstage Tuesday night at a sold-out show at NYC's Madison Square Garden, her last stop on her worldwide "Speak Now" tour. The country superstar, 21, invited fellow singer Selena Gomez for a duet -- their very first together!

As the crowd went absolutely wild, Swift and her "best friend" Gomez, 18, went pop for a live rendition of Gomez's hit "Who Says?"
