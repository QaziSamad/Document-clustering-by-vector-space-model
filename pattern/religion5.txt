A major study by the Pew Research Center’s Forum on Religion & Public Life released Monday finds that advocacy on behalf of the religion has increased more than fivefold in the past 40 years. The report—“Lobbying for the Faithful: Religious Advocacy Groups in Washington, D.C.”—reveals that there are now more than 200 groups with offices in the District of Columbia. In 1970, there were fewer than 40.

The issue agendas of the various groups cover a wide range of interests. Domestically, the most common matters are church-state relations, civil rights and religious liberty, bioethics and life (including abortion, capital punishment and end-of-life concerns), and marriage and family (such as the definition of marriage, domestic violence and fatherhood initiatives).
