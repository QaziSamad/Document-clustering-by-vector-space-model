Star James McAvoy speaks about director Matthew Vaughn’s ideas for the ‘X-Men: First Class’ sequel and how it’ll explore the transformation of Charles Xavier into Professor X.

Thanks to director Matthew Vaughn, Bryan Singer and some creative writing on the part of Ashley Miller, Zack Stentz and others, Twentieth Century Fox has revitalized the team-based aspect of the X-Men franchise.
