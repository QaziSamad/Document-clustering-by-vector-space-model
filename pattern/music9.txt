2011 American Music Awards red carpet fashion: Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez. As always, the talented singer is nominated for several awards, including the coveted Artist of the Year, as well as Favorite Country Album and Favorite Country Female Artist awards.  We're betting Taylor will win big tonight.  

What do you think of Taylor's look?  Too predicatable or dazzling elegance?

Next up is Selena Gomez, who turned up the red carpet heat several notches with a sexy Giorgio Armani satin gown and metallic heels.  From its deep-v neck to the flirty thigh slit to the backless style, Selena's gown and hairstyle channeled her inner old Hollywood glamor siren.  At her side was her favorite entertainer, Justin Bieber.
