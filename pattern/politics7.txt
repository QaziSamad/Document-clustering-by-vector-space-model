A New Jersey couple who gave their children Nazi-inspired names -- including "Adolf Hitler" -- Monday failed in their bid to retain custody of their newborn son.

Heath and Deborah Campbell were seeking to regain custody of five-day-old Hons, whom the Campbells said was taken by Division of Youth and Family Services (DYFS) officials last Thursday, after Deborah gave birth at a local hospital.

It was not clear if the court hearing involved the couple's three other children, who have been in foster care since 2009.
