V IS FOR VENGEANCE
By Sue Grafton (G.P. Putnam's Sons, 448 pages, $27.95)
This is private investigator Kinsey Millhone as her fans know and love her. Sue Grafton is back in top form with her 22nd novel featuring the intrepid heroine after a somewhat disappointing "U Is for Undertow." The plot of "V" is smart, complex and rich with action. A simple shoplifting case leads to a ring of professional thieves and an investigation into a murder. Grafton expertly weaves all these pieces together in the end for a wonderfully satisfying romp that left me looking forward to W.JUDY ROMANOWICH SMITH.
