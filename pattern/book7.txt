From there, In "V is for Vengeance", Grafton weaves a frightening but ultimately redemptive tale of people so well-drawn that they seem as familiar as neighbors, good and bad. Along the way, the ever-resourceful Grafton, whose plots are conceived with an acute intelligence, infuses this well-paced novel with more than one shocker.

But though the plot's the thing, Grafton, as always, gives her readers much more as she continues to stretch her talents — and the boundaries of the genre. Kinsey is determined, gutsy and loyal — and willing to bend the law when it suits the greater good. And Grafton updates us on Kinsey's personal life and those of her friends.
