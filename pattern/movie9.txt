DEATHLY HALLOWS PART 2 picks up exactly where PART 1 ended with Harry, Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) still on the beach having narrowly escaped the clutches of Bellatrix LeStrange (Helena Bonham Carter). The biggest takeaway I had after watching the rousing HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 2 (PG-13, 3 1/2 stars) was I still can’t believe the filmmakers were able to successfully complete the series without sacrificing quality.
