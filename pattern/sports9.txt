A weakened Real Madrid scored four times in the first 20 minutes on their way to a 6-2 hammering of Dinamo Zagreb which secured the Spaniards first place in Champions League Group D last night.

The fact is that Dynamo was hugely overmatched, and outclassed at the Bernabéu: all the remnants of Madrid's 0-1 barely-a-win in Croatia were wiped out within seconds, as Nuri Sahin and Xabi Alonso orchestrated a couple of brilliant attacks through the center of the pitch and down the left wing. Benzema's first came after a series of magnificent interactions in the center of the pitch courtesy of Xabi, Sahin, Özil, Higuaín and Fabio Coentrão, who didn't lose control of the ball until it was in the net.
