Kanye West has launched an interesting defense against charges the lyrics to his Daft Punk-sampling hit "Stronger" resemble those on a track submitted to his management by a Virgina songwriter named Vincent Peters: He's stating the obvious and admitting they come straight from Friedrich Nietzsche.

Peters first sued West last year and a a federal judge dismissed the case in early 2011, proclaiming the songs weren't similar enough (lyrics-wise; the music is not at issue). But Peters appealed, and as the Hollywood Reporter notes, the two tracks are both called "Stronger," both cite the Nietzsche philosophy "That which does not kill us makes us stronger," both rhyme "stronger" with "longer," and both reference Kate Moss.
