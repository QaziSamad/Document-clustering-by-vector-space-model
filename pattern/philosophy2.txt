You’d probably be surprised to hear that an international music superstar gets his lyrical inspiration from a 19th-century existentialist philosopher. At least until we told you it was Kanye West.

Both men admit that their lyrics are inspired on some level by the Friedrich Nietzsche maxim, “That which does not kill us makes us stronger,” a saying which everyone on the planet has heard at some point in their lives. Kanye’s lawyers are making the case that rhymes based on a popular saying your grandmother told you when you fell off your bike shouldn’t be subject to copyright laws.
