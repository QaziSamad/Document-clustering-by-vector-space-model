The parents of a child named Adolf Hitler have lost custody of their fourth child less than a day after he was born.
The newborn infant was named Hons, arguable a more conventional choice than those made for Adolf and his sisters JoyceLynn Aryan Nation and Honszlynn Hinler Jeannie.
Heath and Deborah Campbell complained that their new son had "basically been kidnapped" by New Jersey social services, just 18 hours after the birth. The authorities were alerted by the doctor who delivered the baby.
The Campbells' other children have been in custody since January 2009.
