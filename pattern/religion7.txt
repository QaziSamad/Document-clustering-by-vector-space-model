The report—“Lobbying for the Faithful: Religious Advocacy Groups in Washington, D.C.”—reveals that there are now more than 200 groups with offices in the District of Columbia. In 1970, there were fewer than 40.

Their collective budgets for lobbing efforts in Washington were estimated at $390 million a year. For 131 of the groups for which data could be obtained, median spending was $890,000 in 2009, down from $970,000 the year before.

Forty groups accounted for the bulk of the spending, led by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which spent nearly $88 million in 2008, the last year for which data was provided.
