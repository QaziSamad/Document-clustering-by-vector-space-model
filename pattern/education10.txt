Two Stanford seniors and three recent graduates – the most in university history – have been named Rhodes Scholars by the Rhodes Trust. That brings to 107 the number of Stanford students or alumni who have been named Rhodes Scholars.

"We are proud that our students have been recognized by the Rhodes Trust not only for their academic strength, but for their dedication to pursuits outside the classroom," said Provost John Etchemendy. "They all excel in areas of public service. All five Stanford students selected this year are dedicating their academic careers to disciplines and interests that will make a positive difference for the world. I expect that as other Stanford Rhodes Scholars before them, their future endeavors will leave a positive, lasting impact."
