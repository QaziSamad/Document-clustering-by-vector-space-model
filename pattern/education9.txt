Stanford University students won five Rhodes Scholarships, while Harvard, Brown and Princeton students took four each as the 32 U.S. recipients of one of the world's most prestigious academic awards were named today.

With today's results, 3,260 Americans representing 314 colleges and universities have received Rhodes Scholarships, the Trust said.

Scholars are nominated by their universities and finalists are interviewed. This year, Rhodes finalist Patrick Witt, a quarterback on Yale's football team, chose not to interview because it conflicted with yesterday's game against Harvard.
