"V Is for Vengeance", by Sue Grafton, begins with Kinsey Millhone nursing a broken nose (and two black eyes) that she got from poking it into other people's business.
The hardworking private detective was shopping in the lingerie section of a department store when she spotted a pair of women who were shoplifting, and they were making quite a haul: a lacy teddy here, a pair of silk pajamas there. But Kinsey, a former cop, wasn't about to let them get away with it. She reported them to the salesclerk. Security was called. One woman was arrested, the other one got away.
