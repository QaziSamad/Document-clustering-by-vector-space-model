James McAvoy Discusses His Wishes for X-Men: First Class 2.

Twentieth Century Fox has yet to officially announce a sequel for X-Men: First Class, but that hasn't stopped cast members from talking about it. Michael Fassbender, who played Erik Lensherr, a.k.a. Magneto, recently revealed that he's "looking forward to working with all those people again," and Jason Flemyng, who plays the teleporter Azazel, recently said that "fingers crossed I'll be bright red again by next summer." James McAvoy, who played Charles Xavier, a.k.a. Professor X, agrees with the idea of a sequel.
