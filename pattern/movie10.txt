Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part II is very much a game based on the film, beginning with a long cut scene which delivers the gamer into the underground vaults of Gringotts Bank. The graphics are realistic and a lack of awkward camera angles makes the user truly feel like they have the magic. At the DVD release of the final film, "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part II", at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter Celebuzz caught up with a number of "Harry Potter" cast members, including Ron Weasley himself, Rupert Grint.
