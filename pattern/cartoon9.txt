James McAvoy has said that the storyline to the sequel of X-Men: First Class is "fantastic".
McAvoy played Professor X in this summer's blockbuster, and has revealed that the writing team have once again come up trumps.
He told Collider: "I've heard a little bit about what's happening. The director has got a fantastic idea for what the story will be. I can't really tell you what it is because we may or may not make that, but we've got to do something intelligent with it.
"I can't speak for Michael's [Fassbender, who played Magneto] character, but for my character, he's got some major s**t to deal with."
