Mostly unknown rapper/songwriter Vincent Peters has appealed his case that claims Kanye West stole "Stronger" from him after the lawsuit was dismissed by a federal judge earlier this year. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the lawsuit refers to the following similarities between Peters and Yeezy's songs: they share the title "Stronger," both have references to supermodel Kate Moss, and both rhyme stronger, longer, and wronger in their hooks.

Yeezy's legal team is fighting the case with the argument that he stole the idea for the song not from Peters, but from philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche.
