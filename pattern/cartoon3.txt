British actor James McAvoy has revealed how he and his X-Men: First Class co star, Michael Fassbender are dead set on making a sequel to this summer’s superhero hit. However, James stated that it appears that getting together with Michael and also the movies director and the script writer will be the key to getting the film made sooner rather than later.

McAvoy explained, "We have talked a little bit about a second film. Michael and I are very much up for doing it and have some good ideas".
