From Jennifer Hudson's silver sizzler to Audrina Patridge's old Hollywood glam style and Sarah Hyland's edgy, metallic style, the red carpet looked like a sea of minis.  That's about to take a sexy turn with the arrivals of Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez.

First up is Taylor Swift who showed us why she always makes the best dressed list.  The elegant entertainer rocked the red carpet in a strapless, sequined, full-length gold Reem Acra gown.  Taylor changed up her red carpet style a bit with some dazzling gem earrings.  She kept her hair chic and simple with a sleek side ponytail.
