The couple that entered the national spotlight for naming their children Adolf Hitler, Aryan Nation and Honszlynn Hinler, have lost custody of their newborn, Hons. They have already lost custody of their other three children.

Deborah Campbell gave birth to Hons last week, and under orders from a Flemington, N.J., family court, the baby was taken away from her and her husband, Heath Campbell, hours later.
