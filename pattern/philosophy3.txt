Kanye West has cited Friedrich Nietzsche in his attempt to get the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals to uphold the dismissal of a claim that he stole the song "Stronger". 

The claim came from Vincent Peters, who said that West was given "Stronger" through his manager John Monopoly, after Peters gave it to Monopoly first. The claim was dismissed earlier this year. 

In the appeal, West's attorney Carrie Hall writes: "It would create a dangerously low threshold for establishing copyright protection over otherwise commonplace words and phrases."
