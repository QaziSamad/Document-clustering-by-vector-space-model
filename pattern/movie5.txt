Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part II is very much a game based on the film, beginning with a long cut scene which delivers the gamer into the underground vaults of Gringotts Bank. The graphics are realistic and a lack of awkward camera angles makes the user truly feel like they have the magic. 

With respect to Part I, the user interface has, for the most part, been improved. Selecting spells is no longer through an out-of-game menu, which significantly increases fluidity during a battle. Spells also appear to be more powerful/distance-specific, which makes the lack of a melee attack less frustrating (you no longer have to stupefy a person 3+ times when they’re stood directly in front of you!).
