In "V is for Vengeance," the 22nd installment in Sue Grafton's best-selling and award-winning series featuring private investigator Kinsey Millhone of Santa Teresa, Calif., a fictionalized version of Santa Barbara, the victims and the violators connect in shocking ways.

The shoplifter, 63-year-old Audrey Vance, is observed in the act by Kinsey. After Kinsey tips off the sales clerk, who alerts the loss manager, Audrey is arrested and jailed overnight before being bailed out by her boyfriend, Marvin Striker. When Audrey's body is discovered, Kinsey feels the needles of guilt — but she's more surprised when Marvin asks her to look into Audrey's death.
