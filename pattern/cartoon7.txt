With the film making $350 million on its $150 million budget, it’s no surprise that Fox is looking to get a few more films made. We’ve had confirmations that McAvoy is contracted for three films total as Charles Xavier and we’re also hearing that Matthew Vaughn is in the process of pitching the second installment, though they’re not just rushing right into it. With the first film having been a bit of a rush job with the changes that were at hand, it’s good to see that they’re trying to slow things down a bit more here to handle it better, since as much fun as X-Men: First Class was, you could see that it wasn’t the most seamless of pictures at times. McAvoy had some choice things to say about his character going forward, though I do wish they’d stop referencing the previous trilogy of films and just admit this is a reboot since the two have so many differences to them.
