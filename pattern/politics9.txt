The New Jersey parents who were thrust into the national spotlight for naming their son Adolf Hitler lost custody of their newest baby boy just hours after he was delivered, the family said.

Heath and Deborah Campbell told the Lehigh Valley's Express-Times that child welfare agents took their son, Hons Campbell, at around 6:50 p.m. on Thursday after the doctor who delivered him called the New Jersey Division of Youth and Family Services.
