Is it true that the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 filmmakers want an Best Picture Oscar for their last film? Will they get one?

You want me to peer into minds of the Dementors at the Academy? I'll pass; I prefer that my brain remain in solid form. I can say this: Yes, someone behind the Potter franchise wants a little gold house elf for Deathly Hallows Part 2 and has withdrawn quite a stash from Gringott's to make it happen. But is the flick even worthy?
