The biggest takeaway I had after watching the rousing HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 2 (PG-13, 3 1/2 stars) was I still can’t believe the filmmakers were able to successfully complete the series without sacrificing quality.

Translating J.K. Rowling’s massive book series to film was a daunting challenge from the start, but when you think about the compressed schedule in which these films were made – eight films in 10 years – and all the things that could go wrong (actor revolt, fan disinterest, diminishing returns), completing the series remains an impressive feat.
