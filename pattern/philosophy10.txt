Kanye West is battling a claim from a fellow artist who alleges West’s 2007 hit “Stronger” — which Toronto fans can expect to hear in concert tonight — is a rip-off of a song he sent to the rapper’s business manager.

Peters was undeterred. As Nietzsche once said: "All things are subject to interpretation. Whichever interpretation prevails at a given time is a function of power and not truth."
 
An appeal to a higher authority was made, giving West's attorney, Carrie Hall at Pryor Cashman, an opportunity to ridicule the plaintiff for his song theft allegations.
