Say what you want about the ever-controversial Kanye West, but the man knows his philosophers. The ‘Watch the Throne‘ rapper is citing Nietzsche in his response to a lawsuit over his 2007 single ‘Stronger.’

The Hollywood Reporter snagged a copy of a legal brief of the case. Virginia man Vincent Peters is suing the rapper for copyright infringement, claiming West stole the idea and some lyrics of ‘Stronger’ from a song Peters released in 2006. Peters claims he gave a copy of his own song to West’s business manager, John Monopoly (really, that name is just asking for it). Peters believes that Monopoly, in turn, gave West a listen to the song — and spurned the copyright infringement.
