Kanye West is battling a claim from a fellow artist who alleges West’s 2007 hit “Stronger” — which Toronto fans can expect to hear in concert tonight — is a rip-off of a song he sent to the rapper’s business manager.

Both tunes riff off 19th-century philosopher Frederich Nietzsche’s oft-quoted maxim, “that which doesn’t kill us makes us stronger.” Both songs are share a reference to super-model Kate Moss and share a rhyme scheme involving the words, “stronger,” “wronger” and “longer.”
