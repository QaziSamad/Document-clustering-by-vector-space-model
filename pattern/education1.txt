Stanford University students won five Rhodes Scholarships, the most in the school’s history, while Harvard, Brown and Princeton each were awarded four as the 32 U.S. recipients of one of the world’s most prestigious academic awards were named yesterday.

The University of Washington had two scholars and California State University Long Beach and Bard College had their first-ever recipients, according to a statement from the Office of the American Secretary of the Rhodes Trust.
