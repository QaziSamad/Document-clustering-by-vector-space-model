A poignant and action-packed end to a massive series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 was, despite its flaws, an impressive finale. While the changes - most notably the final duel between Harry and Voldemort at Hogwarts - were significant, not much took away from the overall story of Harry and his friends trying to destroy Horcruxes to vanquish the dark overlord once and for all. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson have far passed their early awkward days in front of the camera as Harry, Ron, and Hermione, and hold their own as proper action and even dramatic actors - most notably Grint, whose cries of anguish over the loss of a sibling were gut-wretching to watch.
