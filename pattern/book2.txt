With V Is for Vengeance, released today, Sue Grafton has charged her way through the alphabet in a crime series that has endeared millions of fans to scrappy private detective Kinsey Millhone.

From the first novel — A Is for Alibi, published in 1982 — to Z Is for Zero, which Grafton says will be the title of the last installment, the series has remained consistently entertaining and, many readers think, gotten better and better.

V Is for Vengeance, set in the 1980s as is the rest of the series, builds slowly but surely to a crafty conclusion full of surprises and a neat wrap-up of loose ends.
