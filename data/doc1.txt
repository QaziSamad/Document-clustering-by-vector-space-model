Canada concluded the second round of CONCACAF World Cup qualifying on Tuesday with a  4-0 win over St. Kitts and Nevis in front of 10,235 at BMO field in Toronto.

The two sides shared the spoils in their first encounter last week, but Canada made no mistake this time as Josh Simpson, Dwayne De Rosario, Olivier Occean and Tosaint Ricketts netted for the Canucks.

"It's a great performance all around," De Rosario said in a post-match interview with Sportsnet. "These guys wanted to show the fans that we can score. We proved it tonight."

A scoreless draw in the Caribbean had secured progression to Round 3 of CONCACAF qualifying but failed to impress.

"The future definitely looks bright when you look at it today," DeRo said.

De Rosario, who was the leading goal scorer in Major League Soccer this past season, capped off his outstanding year with a goal from the penalty spot in the 35th minute, putting him level with Dale Mitchell for the all-time goal-scoring record with the Canadian national team.

The Canucks will now move on to the third round of qualification where they will be facing much stiffer opponents. Round three consists of three groups of four, where Canada is in Group C with Honduras, Cuba and Panama. The top two teams from each group will move on to the fourth and final round.

Round three starts on June 8, 2012 and will run until Oct. 16.
