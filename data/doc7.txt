World War I radically altered the diplomatic and political situations in Eurasia and Africa, with the defeat of the 
Central Powers, including Austria-Hungary, Germany, and the Ottoman Empire, and the 1917 Bolshevik seizure of power 
in Russia. Meanwhile, the success of the Allied Entente powers, including the United Kingdom, France, the United States,
 Italy, Serbia, and Romania, and the creation of new states from the collapse of Austria-Hungary and the Russian Empire, 
resulted in fundamental changes to the map of Eastern Europe. In the aftermath of the war, major unrest arose in Europe, 
especially irredentist and revanchist nationalism and class conflict. Irredentism and revanchism were strong in Germany 
because she was forced to accept significant territorial, colonial, and financial losses as part of the Treaty of
 Versailles. Under the treaty, Germany lost around 13 percent of its home territory and all of its overseas colonies,
 while German annexation of other states was prohibited, massive reparations were imposed, and limits were placed on the 
size and capability of Germany's armed forces.[7] Meanwhile, the Russian Civil War led to the creation of the Soviet 
Union. After Lenin's death in 1924, Joseph Stalin seized power in the USSR and repudiated the New Economic Policy, 
favouring Five Year Plans instead.[8]
