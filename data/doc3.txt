MLS released the list of each team's protected players on Monday, ahead of Wednesday's Expansion Draft.

The draft will take place at 2 p.m. ET on Nov. 23, and the Montreal Impact – set to become MLS' 19th team – will be able to select 10 unprotected players, with the caveat that they cannot select more than one player from each team.

“We are really excited about this process and have been waiting a long time for this day to come,” said Impact director of soccer operations Matt Jordan. “We’ve been studying the possibilities over the last few months and are now ready to get to work.”

Each team was allowed to protect 11 players, with Generation Adidas and homegrown players on a team's off-budget roster exempt from selection. Furthermore, teams with four or more international players were required to protect at least three.

Below are the lists of protected players from each team, along with exempt players. A player with an asterisk (*) next to his name graduated from his Generation Adidas contract, meaning his team had to protect him to ensure him not being selected.
