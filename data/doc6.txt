As you know, OpenGL contains rendering commands but is designed to be independent of any window system or operating system.
 Consequently, it contains no commands for opening windows or reading events from the keyboard or mouse. Unfortunately, 
it's impossible to write a complete graphics program without at least opening a window, and most interesting programs 
require a bit of user input or other services from the operating system or window system. In many cases, complete 
programs make the most interesting examples, so this book uses GLUT to simplify opening windows, detecting input, and 
so on. If you have an implementation of OpenGL and GLUT on your system, the examples in this book should run without 
change when linked with them.In addition, since OpenGL drawing commands are limited to those that generate simple 
geometric primitives (points, lines, and polygons), GLUT includes several routines that create more complicated 
three-dimensional objects such as a sphere, a torus, and a teapot. This way, snapshots of program output can be 
interesting to look at. (Note that the OpenGL Utility Library, GLU, also has quadrics routines that create some of 
the same three-dimensional objects as GLUT, such as a sphere, cylinder, or cone.)

GLUT may not be satisfactory for full-featured OpenGL applications, but you may find it a useful starting point for 
learning OpenGL. The rest of this section briefly describes a small subset of GLUT routines so that you can follow the 
programming examples in the rest of this book. (See Appendix D for more details about this subset of GLUT, or see 
Chapters 4 and 5 of OpenGL Programming for the X Window System for information about the rest of GLUT.)
