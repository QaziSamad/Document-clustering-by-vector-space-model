On 1 September 1939, Germany and Slovakia—a client state in 1939—attacked Poland. On 3 September 1939, France and Britain, 
followed by the countries of the Commonwealth, declared war on Germany but provided little support to Poland other than 
a small French attack into the Saarland.[41] Britain and France also began a naval blockade of Germany on 3 September 
which aimed to damage the country's economy and war effort.[42][43] On 17 September 1939, after signing a cease-fire 
with Japan, the Soviets also invaded Poland.[44] Poland's territory was divided between Germany and the the Soviet Union, 
with Lithuania and Slovakia also receiving small shares. The Poles did not surrender and established a Polish Underground
 State, an underground Home Army, and continued to fight with the Allies on all fronts outside Poland.[45] In the 
Romanian Bridgehead operation, some 120,000 Polish troops were evacuated to France, along with much of the Polish Air
 Force and Poland's Enigma codebreakers.[46] During this time, Japan launched its first attack against Changsha, a 
strategically important Chinese city, but was repulsed by late September.[47]

Following the invasion of Poland and agreement on a German-Soviet treaty governing Lithuania, the Soviet Union forced 
the Baltic countries to allow it to station Soviet troops in their countries under pacts of "mutual assistance."
[48][49][50] Finland rejected territorial demands and the Soviet Union invaded in November 1939.[51] The resulting 
conflict ended in March 1940 with Finnish concessions.[52] France and the United Kingdom, treating the Soviet attack on 
Finland as tantamount to entering the war on the side of the Germans, responded to the Soviet invasion by supporting the
 USSR's expulsion from the League of Nations.[50]
